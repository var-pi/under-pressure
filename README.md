The purpose of Under Pressure is to let students monitor how much stress some subjects have created for them and in the future be able to compare their result against the median stress value calculated with input from other students.

The website is still a work in progress and contains bugs. It is also right now hosted on a free hosting platform where the backend "hybernates" over a longer period of not being used, which might cause a minute long delay for the first request.
